Replaces Toyota part numbers on Toyodiy with clickable Trodo.com shopping
links. Toyota part numbers have the format:

xxxxx-xxxxx

Where x can be an alphanumeric character, e.g.:

31115-16050
90910-02100
16100-19226
9002A-36809

Part numbers with alphabetical characters are rarer but do exist!

Some parts may have an extra -xx suffix added (e.g., 45100-10430-B0) where the
part has multiple trim options. These generally aren't shoppable, so links are
not added for these.
